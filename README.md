# My_Roadmap
This repo contains an Excel built roadmap I used to structure my learning to become a Data Analyst.

Note that the xlsx file contains features that may only work for Microsoft Excel 2016 or later.

The file utilized conditional formating, formulas, and functions to make the schedule interactive and current.

I have also taken most of the courses in the schedule and will recommend them to anyone starting their journey in Data analysis

Reach out to me in case you face any challenges trying to use it.
